                    <h3>Highlights from the past season</h3>
                    <p>
                        What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th 
                        year of running trips down the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 
                        trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one
                        of our favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and 
                        welcomed them to our family. The season started off with some 
                        chilly weather in the early season, but our guests braved the cold
                        and loved every minute of their trip.

                        Later the temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in the 
                        Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. We didn't have any trouble 
                        getting people in the water at those temperatures.

                    <h3>Encounters in the wild!</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the 
                        United States. We share these areas with lots of critters both 
                        large and small. Here are some tips on what to do if you should 
                        find yourself face to face with one.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Scorpions</h4>
                    <p class="article-srcoll">
                        There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of them being 
                        harmless. There are, however, a handful of them that can be 
                        dangerous and even potentially lethal. Scorpions can be found in 
                        almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their environment. 
                        The scorpion that calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is 
                        the Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in the United States. Do not 
                        worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to their prey and 
                        luckily humans are not on that list!
                    </p>
                    <h4>Big horn sheep</h4>
                    <p class="article-srcoll">
                        For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the rugged mountain west. 
                        It is one of two species of wild sheep in North America. It's 
                        compact body is muscular with chocolate brown fur. Most weigh 
                        160-250 Ibs. They have exceptional vision, hearing and smell that 
                        helps them detect and avoid predators. Their large curved horns 
                        can weigh up to 30 lbs. Females also have horns but they are short 
                        with a slight curvature. Horns are used as tools for eating and 
                        fighting.
