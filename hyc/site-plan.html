About us:

Yu-Chieh Hsieh is a brave girl from Taiwan and a professional 
tennis and pickleball player. We are committed to supporting 
her to showcase her best performance without any worries in 
international tournaments and cheering for her dreams and achievements. 
Here, we will follow her events and life together, 
and support her through purchasing pickleball products.

Yu-Chieh's words:

I really want more people to experience the charm of pickleball 
and hope to be with a group of friends who love this sport. 
In my travels around the world for competitions and training, 
I have experienced many setbacks and difficulties due to insufficient 
resources. But I still firmly love my sports career and look forward 
to everyone's support. Whether it is cheering for me in competitions, 
following my updates on social media, or even supporting me by 
purchasing FPPA merchandise, it can give me strength and help me 
achieve higher goals. At this moment, I may be on my way to training 
or on the competition field. Your support will give me more 
opportunities to stand on the podium.
